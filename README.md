This app was started as a fun side project for learning React Native. In the past I tried flutter but the complex inheritance of the UI widgets was often led to me to so complex widget tree that I couldn't manage after a while.

In the past I've designed a few mobile app's, website's UI and UX, and it was important to have the abilility to create complex UI's easily, luckily I found it in React Native.
